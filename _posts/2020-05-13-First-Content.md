So this is a blog huh? Seems pretty easy to set up, even if it is a bit round-abouty.

It's been a while since I've had to write anything in my own, non-scientific, voice. I almost don't know what to do or say :smirk:

My first instinct is that this is hypocritical - I often find that people who feel the need to *express* themselves are a bit... 
I don't know... needy? And I really don't want to be seen that way. I'm the kind of guy who keeps to himself, does what's expected of him,
doesn't voice opinions on every little issue (especially when I have no basis or background to base that opinion on) so I'm just going to 
have to get used to this idea I guess. If I think that this is "for my eyes only" perhaps that'll make it easier.

Yes, totally talking to myself and finding that its _ok_ if this is for my eyes only.

Anyway, I'm only practising here so let's move on... Who knows, this might become a thing? :thought_balloon:
